# CS56 Utilities Payment Method Validator
## Introduction
Compliance with (a).
The purpose of our project is to replace the CS56 Utilities Payment Method Validator desktop app with an applicable web appliication. Further, the web application will include bugfixes with regards to the functionality of the desktop app.
## Current Functionality
Compliance with (b), (c).
Currently the user may generate up to one credit card number at a time.
The feature to generate more than one credit card number at a time is nonfunctional.
User can also validate credit card number.
### Current use case scenarios

#### Scenario 1:
User runs app locally on system. User generates credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count = 1. The generator generates a single card number.

#### Scenario 2:
User runs app locally on system. User generates credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count > 1. The generator generates a single card number. This is a bug.

#### Scenario 3:
User runs app locally on system. User validates credit card with any desired card type. The generator validates the card number.



## Future Functionality
Compliance with (d), (g), (h)

When our app is complete, we wish for the following scenarios to be additonally possible.

#### Scenario 1:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to generate credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count = 1. The app generates a single card number.

#### Scenario 2:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to generate credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count > 1. The app generates a the desired number of card numbers.

#### Scenario 3:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to validate credit card with any desired card type. The app validates the card number.

#### Scenario 4:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to validate bitcoin address. The app validates the bitcoin address.

The current issues consitute for the creation of an entirely different application, with different frameworks as appropriate.
There are certainly enough issues to earn 1,000 points. The expectations are clear.

In terms of functionality, we can certainly add the feature to validate Bitcoin addresses. With the advent of crypto-currency, this is certainly a useful feature. (Michael)

Another possible feature without modifying the GUI is to generate a picture of how the credit card looks like after user clicking the generate button. (Deren)

## Current quality of the README.md (e)
A few screenshots of how the app looks like could be added to the README.md to make everything more straight forward.

## Current state of the build.xml file (f)
The current build.xml has all the necessary functionality and we haven't seen any unncessary things that need to be removed. Since we are going to use Maven or Gradle for this project as the issue #23 described, the potential problems of build file will be soved using another build tool instead of ant.

## Evaluation of Current Materials and Code
Compliance with (i), (j)
The current codes are well organized. There are several Java files doing independent jobs: Menu, generators for different car types with test file for each feature. Methods for how to recognize each card types are clear and simple (analyze string), so the code is easy to read and understand. However, I believe the Menu.java file need more explenation because it is relatively long and tedious. Deren believe refactoring is somehow important for this file. To help someone else that was going to work on the same project, I would say that: the features of the app are written in different individual java file with tests and connected to the Menu.java which is the mainwindow. Just look through each files because the explenation of the functionality is explicit.

The test covered almost every features in the project. If we can expand test coverage, one possible test is to identify whether generating multiple card numbers could work.

Michael's personal opinion: Because we aim to construct a web app, and the current app is a desktop app, much of the code is irrelevant to our project, and will not be salvaged. The generation and verification algorithims used in the desktop app will be reimlemented in the webapp.

Deren's personal opinion: Since all the features in this project works well, the best way is to keep the existing code and transform it into a web app. If additional features need to be added, we can do them after the transformation.
